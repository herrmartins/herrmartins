## 🌐 About Me and My Approach

[cite_start]I'm a full-stack developer based in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil [cite: 18][cite_start], focused on building clean, scalable, and efficient applications, from database to browser[cite: 20].

[cite_start]I work primarily with Grails, Spring Boot, and Django on the backend [cite: 21][cite_start], and Next.js and Alpine.js on the frontend, also having good knowledge of React[cite: 22]. [cite_start]I enjoy the challenge of delivering both solid architecture behind the scenes and seamless experiences on the surface[cite: 23]. [cite_start]I care about writing code that's readable, testable, and built to last[cite: 24].
